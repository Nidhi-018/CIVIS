https://civis-git-main-nidhis-projects-26959863.vercel.app/

 A centralized web-based dashboard that simulates real-time monitoring of smart city infrastructure such as streetlights, traffic signals, water systems, and waste   management. The system enables proactive maintenance, anomaly detection, and citizen engagement.
 
📌 Problem Overview
Municipal infrastructure often operates with limited real-time monitoring, leading to energy waste, delayed maintenance, and reactive issue resolution. This project demonstrates how IoT-driven monitoring and analytics can modernize city operations.

🎯 Project Objectives
Simulate real-time sensor data ingestion
Detect anomalies and potential failures
Visualize infrastructure health geographically
Generate predictive maintenance alerts
Enable citizen complaint submissions
Assist city officials with maintenance scheduling
